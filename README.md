# Island

Implement a multithreaded raining simulator. Imagine that baseball balls are raining on a desert island. Balls will randomply falling on different positions of the island. Your program will simulate each ball's behaviour on their track from the moment they touch the island until the momment they stop moving in a valley or they sink into the ocean.

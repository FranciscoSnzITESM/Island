# Island in C

This is a project that uses pthreads to simulate the behaviour of balls raining in an Island.

## Island Map 

![Landscape](island.png)

## General Points

- The Map has different levels depending on the height and it has a color assigned to it.
- The colors from low to high are: blue, cyan, green, yellow, red, magenta. (Blue is the lowest, Magenta is the highest).

## Getting Started

- Use the command to compile the program: gcc -o island island.c -pthread.

### Prerequisites

- You need to have a C compiler and the libraries of pthreads to be able to run this project.

### Installing

- Download this repo and use the command line to run the C program.

## Running the tests

- Since this is a program in C, if you want more information on the testing side, we recommend using GDB to test the files.

## Deployment

## Acknowledgments

* This is a project that helped us understand more the use of threads in a real life situation.
* Inspiration, the inspiration for this project was to create an easy to use threads program to understand the use of this in real life simulations.
* Thanks to the Advanced Programming Class for letting us have fun with a project like this.
